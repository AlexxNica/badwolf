{"name":"Badwolf","tagline":"Temporal graph store abstraction layer","body":"BadWolf is a temporal graph store loosely modeled after the concepts introduced\r\nby the\r\n[Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework).\r\nIt presents a flexible storage abstraction, efficient query language, and\r\ndata-interchange model for representing a directed graph that accommodates the\r\nstorage and linking of arbitrary objects without the need for a rigid schema.\r\n\r\nBadWolf began as a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore),\r\nbut triples have been expanded to quads to allow simpler and flexible temporal\r\nreasoning. Because BadWolf is designed for generalized relationship storage,\r\nmost of the web-related idiosyncrasies of RDF are not used and have been toned\r\ndown or directly removed and focuses on its time reasoning aspects.\r\n\r\nIn case you are curious about the name, BadWolf is named after the\r\n[BadWolf entity](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Bad_Wolf_(entity) ) as it appeared\r\nin Dr. Who series episode _\"The Parting Of Ways\"_ after Rose Tyler looked into\r\nthe Time Vortex itself. The BadWolf entity scattered events in time as self\r\nencode messages, creating a looped ontological paradox. Hence, naming a temporal\r\ngraph store after the entity seemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nYou can find more detail information on each of the components of BadWolf below:\r\n\r\n* [Data Abstractions for Temporal Graph Modeling](./docs/temporal_graph_modeling.md).\r\n* [Storage Abstraction Layer](./docs/storage_abstraction_layer.md).\r\n* [Graph Marshaling/Unmarshaling](./docs/graph_serialization.md).\r\n* [BadWolf Query Language overview](./docs/bql.md).\r\n* [BadWolf Query Language planner](./docs/bql_query_planner.md).\r\n* [BadWolf Query Language practical examples](./docs/bql_practical_examples.md).\r\n* [BadWolf command line tool](./docs/command_line_tool.md).\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this project is under active development and there\r\nwill be no guarantees on API stability till the first stable 1.0 release.\r\n\r\nYou can reach us here or via\r\n[@badwolf_project](https://twitter.com/badwolf_project) on Twitter.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/badwolf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/badwolf)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
