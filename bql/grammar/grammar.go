// Package grammar imlements the grammar parser for the BadWolf query language.
// The parser is impemented as a reusable recursive decent parser for a left
// LL(k) left factorized grammar. BQL is an LL(1) grammar however the parser
// is designed to be reusable and help separate the grammar from the parsing
// mechanics to improve maintainablity and flexibility of grammar changes
// by keeping those the code separation clearly delineated.
