# BQL Practical Examples

You may find a collection of examples on the [examples folder](../examples/bql).
Each example file targets a particular BQL feature. The list shown below list
each of the example files with a brief description.

* [First steps](../examples/bql/example_0.bql): This example show how to create
  a graph, insert data, query the graph, and drop the graph. The query shows
  basic functionality on how how to express your graph query using graph
  clauses. The example shows how to search for particular patterns and extract
  IDs from from graph nodes.

* [Expressing graph patterns and grouping](../examples/bql/example_1.bql): This
  example show how you can express complex graph queries by properly binding
  graph clauses together. You will also find examples on how to summary the
  results via the `GROUP BY` clause.

* [Summarizing data queries across graphs](../examples/bql/example_2.bql):
   Some times you want to queries data that is stored across multiple graphs.
   This example shows how you can express queries across multiple graphs and
   summarize the results accordingly.
